 portugal.1.t:0 "The Galician Question"
 portugal.1.desc:0 "The portuguese take pride in living in Greater Portugal, the people we supposedly liberated dont have different opinions. Altough a Galician can clearly understand a portuguese and a portuguese can clearly understand a galician, the galicans have no historical ties to our country and dont have any desire of being part of portugal, tough many are simply satisfied by not being under the communist boot anymore. Even then, many talk of independence.\nOur administration has forged two plans to deal with the issue.\nThe first plan revolves around focusing on the future, by highlighting the shared cultural and linguistical ties that Galicia has with portugal, we can build a shared pan-lusitanian identity, which can bring Galicia into our arms. This plan, whomeoever, will please the liberal, republican faction in our government, as these cultural and linguistical ties are the very same ones that the republicans, socialists, lusotropicalists and even the spanish communists love exalting.\nThe second plan focuses on the past, by highlighting the historical ties that portugal has with galicia, we can truly make Galicia feel as an important part of portugal. The first portuguese king indeed was part of the royal family of galicia. This plan would, whomeoever, please and boost the fascist and monarchist movement in our country, as these historical ties are the very same ones that the many far-right groups use to justify their claims and actions.\nWhatever we choose, Galicia must be firmly portuguese, else it will slip from our hands."
