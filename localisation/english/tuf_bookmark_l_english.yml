 THE_UNION_FOREVER_DESC:0 "As the 70th anaversary of the end of Confederate victory in the US Civil War draws near people are sick of the constant poverty that has plauged the former USA for generations.

 USA_TUF_DESC:0 "After the surrender to the Confederacy in 1866 and subsequent collapse the United States has been struggling. Weather it be near constant economic depression or war with one of its neighboring states, America is a shadow of its former self. Now in the 1930's radicals are gaining more and more mainstream presence. Will the American democracy survive, or will it crumble once more like it did in the 1870s?"
