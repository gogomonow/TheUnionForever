 pra.1.t:0 "The One True America"
 pra.1.desc:0 "The Provisional Republic of America. is in its own words, the only true America.  The United States of America claims the opposite, but due to their incompetent military and administration they can’t do anything about it. The PRA has prospered under president John J. Pershing, one of the greatest men the republic has ever known. But as Pershing’s health fails, who will take the reins of the PRA from this legendary figure once he is gone?"
 pra.1.a:0 "Love Live The PRA!"
